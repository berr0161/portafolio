# Welcome to my portafolio!

I'm Cesar Berrio, I'm an Interactive Media Design Student at Algonquin College.

During the second term of the course, in the class on User Experience, we were required to design a high-fidelity prototype of our portfolio. I decided to go for a simple design that shows all the work I have done in photography, web development and videography. 

I designed my page with three primary colours: white, red, and black. I feel that they generate an excellent contrast between them and represent my personality. Showing a serious and professional tone but also relaxed and flexible.

For the class Web Development II, they asked us to write the code for this design. I took this as a challenge and decided not to use any library like bootstrap and write the HTML and CSS myself and make it work the best as possible.

For the mobile version, the design will go in a column for every element and eventually, for the desktop, change the layout to a flex, flex-reverse and grid for specific pages.

The logo of my portfolio has different ways to appear in desktop and mobile design, so the way I worked is to add the same logo twice in the HTML in the position they go, and on the CSS, hide one of them and make it appear the other corresponding to mobile or desktop.

I wanted to add a black overlay to my images since the background and the text are white, so the text would be readable and generate accessibility. However, I found that a little bit hard since all the covers had different sizes, and I also had to target specific layers to organize them to have the correct order of what is on top.

For the CSS, I decided to have two main CSS. Main.css has all the general styles applied for every page, such as the nav, the footer and buttons. work.css has the styles of all the sub-pages like photography.html, video.html and web-development. HTML.

Also, I created a CSS for each page so I could organize the content in a flex or grid. Since the black cover was different for each page, I just decided to give the same class but have them in other CSS so that I could manipulate them precisely for the way needed for the design.

I have a grid of 2 rows and three columns for the photography sub-page in the desktop Design. I thought it was easier to divide the images into two divs, each containing three images, give them the same class, a display flex, and center them instead of using the grid area.

I re-used the HTML of video.html and used it precisely for web development.html since they have the same design and structure. The only thing that changes is the content.
